Question: What are LLM AI Agents?
Thought: I need information about LLM AI Agents
Action: wikipedia
Action Input: LLM AI Agents
Observation: Page: Large language model
Summary: A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.
The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and provide the core capabilities of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.


Thought:Thought: I now know what LLM AI Agents are, but I'd like to know more about how they work and their applications.
Action: search
Action Input: LLM AI Agent how it works
Observation: 1 day ago - Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment . 2 weeks ago - Traditional LLMs, such as IBM® Granite® models, produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are bounded by knowledge and reasoning limitations. In contrast, agentic technology uses tool calling on the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflows and create ... March 11, 2025 - Secondly, it can establish a historical baseline of how similar issues were previously handled. Another subtask can be summarizing legal documents and forecasting future trends based on observed patterns. To complete these subtasks, the LLM agent requires a structured plan, a reliable memory to track progress, and access to necessary tools. These components form the backbone of an LLM agent ’s workflow... November 13, 2024 - People often think of agents as ... where an LLM routes between two different paths? This fits my technical definition, but not the common perception of what an agent should be capable of. It’s hard to define exactly what an agent is! That’s why I really liked Andrew Ng’s tweet last week. In it he suggests that “rather than arguing over which work to include ... June 12, 2025 - LLM agents are systems that use large language models to reason through complex problems, create plans, and utilize tools or APIs to complete tasks , making them suitable for applications like smart chatbots, automated code generation, and workflow automation.

Thought: I now have a good understanding of how LLM AI Agents work and their applications.
Final Answer: LLM AI Agents are systems that use large language models to reason through complex problems, create plans, and utilize tools or APIs to complete tasks, making them suitable for applications like smart chatbots, automated code generation, and workflow automation.

Question: What are LLM AI Agents?
Thought: I need information about LLM AI Agents
Action: wikipedia
Action Input: LLM AI Agents
Observation: Page: Large language model
Summary: A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.
The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and provide the core capabilities of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.


Thought:Thought: I now know what LLM AI Agents are, but I'd like to know more about how they work and their applications.
Action: search
Action Input: LLM AI Agent how it works
Observation: 1 day ago - Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment . 2 weeks ago - Traditional LLMs, such as IBM® Granite® models, produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are bounded by knowledge and reasoning limitations. In contrast, agentic technology uses tool calling on the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflows and create ... March 11, 2025 - Secondly, it can establish a historical baseline of how similar issues were previously handled. Another subtask can be summarizing legal documents and forecasting future trends based on observed patterns. To complete these subtasks, the LLM agent requires a structured plan, a reliable memory to track progress, and access to necessary tools.
